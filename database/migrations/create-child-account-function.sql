-- Child Account Creation Setup
-- 
-- Child account creation is handled by the 'create-child-account' Supabase Edge Function
-- which has proper service role permissions to create auth users securely.
--
-- The Edge Function is located at: supabase/functions/create-child-account/index.ts
-- and has been deployed to handle:
-- 1. Username uniqueness validation
-- 2. Auth user creation with proper metadata
-- 3. Profile record creation
-- 4. Student record creation
-- 5. Parent-child linking
-- 6. Automatic cleanup on errors
--
-- This approach is more secure than database functions as it uses Supabase's
-- service role permissions through the Edge Function runtime.

-- No database functions needed - everything is handled by the Edge Function!
