## 🚀 How to Test

### Option 1: Quick Portal Testing (Recommended)
1. **Scroll down** on the welcome screen (now working!)
2. **Tap "Student Portal"** or **"Parent Portal"** in the Test Portals section
3. These should now work (though may show mock data initially)

### Option 2: Full Authentication Flow
1. **Tap "Already have an account?"**
2. **Login with any of the test credentials above**
3. **Or create a new account** via "Start Your School"

## 🐛 Current Known Issues
- Database authentication errors (working on fixing)
- Missing navigation screens for some parent features
- Family approvals table relationship issues

## 📱 What Should Work
- ✅ Welcome screen scrolling
- ✅ Basic navigation between screens
- ✅ UI display and design
- ⚠️ Authentication (may need database setup)
- ⚠️ Data loading (may show errors but won't crash)

## 🔧 Database Setup Needed
If you see authentication errors, you may need to:
1. Run the SQL scripts in Supabase
2. Create test users manually
3. Set up proper database tables

## 🎯 Testing Priority
1. **Test scrolling** - scroll down to see all buttons
2. **Test navigation** - tap the portal buttons
3. **Check UI/design** - verify the rebranded look
4. **Report any crashes** - app should handle errors gracefully
